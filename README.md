# Equilibrium_of_Heterogeneous
This is a repository for the open-source typesetting of Josiah Willard Gibbs' "On the Equilibrium of Heterogeneous Substances." 
I am looking for passionate volunteers to help with improving this work. Please contact me if interested in helping with the typesetting.
We are also interested in insightful commentary on the piece, and eventually to 'translate' the piece into less baroque english.
If you are interested in the more demanding task of helping in this translation, we are also looking for passionate, qualified volunteers to assist with this. Again, please contact me if you are interested.
